# Repair-management-system
The Repair Management System is a Python console-based application designed to manage equipment, repair categories, repair requests, and repair costs.

The system allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on equipment and repair requests through an interactive menu.
It simulates a real-world maintenance workflow and focuses on data handling, validation, and cost analysis.
